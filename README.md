**Project Title:**

Retail Sales Region Analysis

**Problem:**

A retail company suspected underperformance in certain regions. My task was to clean, analyze, and summarize the sales data to provide insights by region.

**Dataset:**

70,000+ sales records with missing values, messy region names, and inconsistent formatting.

**What I Did:**
* Cleaned and standardized the dataset using Python (pandas, NumPy)
* Engineered features (total_sales, high_value_order)
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Built visualizations and a summary table for regional performance
* Identified North as the top-performing region with highest revenue and % of high-value orders

**Key Insight:**

North region had the highest revenue and the most high-value orders, indicating possible marketing advantages or demand variation.

**Tools Used:**
* Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
* VS Code + Jupyter extension
* Git & GitHub
